# Work-Day-Scheduler

##Description

This is a Work Day Scheduler for planning out a user's day. The application can be used for an person that would like to type out what tasks they need to complete each hour from 9:00am to 5:00pm. A user can type in each entry box and save their input with the save icon on the side or each bar. If a user closes the app and re-opens it, they will see their last tasks saved. The app has an internal clock that keeps track of what hour in the day it is. The current hour is marked in red, past in gray, and future in green. With this application a user can plan out their day!
